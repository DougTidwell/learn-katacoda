Congratulations! You're now officially a serverless computing pioneer. Over the last few minutes, you have: 

1. Deployed a service to Knative
1. Invoked that service via a web app
1. Watched Knative scale the service to zero
1. Re-invoked the service and watched Knative restart it

To continue your journey towards complete mastery of serverless computing and Knative, check out these resources: 

*  Our friend Kamesh Sampath's excellent **Knative Tutorial** is not to be missed. 
* The complete Compile Driver series is available on the Red Hat Developer program site. It consists of three articles, four videos, and three git repos. 
* It goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway:  Be sure to join the Red Hat Developer program to get access to Red Hat products and exclusive resources. (The Container Development Kit, for example, lets you build the environment you used here on your machine.)
* There are several articles on the Red Hat Developer blog that you'll find really useful: 
  * William Markito Olivera's series on 
  * Kamesh's three-part series on Knative basics
  * What else?
