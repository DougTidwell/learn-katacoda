## The Compile Driver 

The Compile Driver is a new thrill ride at the Coderland theme park. It starts by hoisting guests to the top 
of an enormous tower. From there, they endure a terrifying plunge through the air towards the reinforced concrete pad at 
the base of the ride. Many parkgoers have asked for a photo of their experience, something they could 
share with their friends, loved ones, and attorneys. 

Seeing the opportunity to generate additional revenue from the Compile Driver, management installed a webcam next to the ride. 
Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to create a souvenir photo 
by superimposing the Coderland logo, a message, and a date stamp on an image captured by the webcam. 
As they stagger away from the ride, guests can buy a print of that image for $19.95 at the Coderland Swag Shop. 

In this exercise you'll use Knative Serving to deploy the image manipulation code to a serverless environment. You'll use
Knative and Istio on top of OpenShift, and you'll see how the different frameworks and platforms work together.
